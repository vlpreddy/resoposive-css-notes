1. META TAG

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

content="width=device-width
      ----- this means width of content should be allways same to the width of the device
initial-scale=1.0
       --- what type zoom level when you load the page first time, if you change value to 2.0, you will see the chage in zoom
       
2. MEDIA QUERY
    --- orientation:portrait
           We can use orientation to write different css
    --- min-aspect-ratio:16/9
           We can use aspect ratio to write different css
    --- (width > 300px)
        (100px<=width<=width<=300px)
             it is easy compare to normal range of media query but currently browser compatibility              is around 70% (but we can us POST CSS to do simiar range)
 
3.  CONTAINER QUERY
    @container() - seems browser support also going to be more promising
      

4. CUSTOM MEDIA QUERY
        @custome-media --small (width>=400px)
        @media(--small) 
        Browser support is worst (this we can do in POST CSS)

5. different html pages for different devices only when you have a complex and completly different body structure, not recommended to do 

6. CSS GRID
       Perfect for responsive design
